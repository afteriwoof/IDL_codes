Wrote CALC_DOWN.pro to determine the downward force in our observed deflection and compare this to the deflection force an object along our CME trajectory would experience in a simple dipole. The results will show that if their form is different then additional forces must be at play over just the dipole field (argues for gas pressure, driving forces, etc.).

Jason,
You should be able to replicate our website images with:

IDL> bytimg=scc_mk_image(filename,times=3)

That's the short answer. The long answer is that the cor2 images on our website come from total-brightness images computed from the polarized sequences. These are created with the command:

IDL> secchi_prep, three_filenames, hdrout, imout, savepath=outdir, /polariz, /write_fts,  /calimg_off, /nocalfac, /precomm, /pipeline

and then the output of this command (FITS file) is input into scc_mk_image.pro. These images are generated with the scc_daily_pretties.pro.

Email about the figures.
Reading Wang et al., 2009:
What thermodynamic process does the CME plasma under- 
go? What happens with the various forces involved? 
Limited knowledge on these global issues were obtained 
through indirect ways, largely from the statistical combina- 
tion of observations of many CMEs from multiple space- 
craft over a long time period.axis and independent of time. 

It should be noted that all the above conclusions were 
established on statistical surveys, which cannot review the 
detailed evolution behavior of any individual CMEs.

Found a problem with the cor2a/1052, 1122 and 1152 fronts - wasn't using the most updated ones.

So,
Had to go to 1122/.../slices_all and use gather_ells,/fronts to remake ells_fronts1122.sav
Then go to ells_comb/ and restore,'../ells_fronts/ells_fronts1122.sav' and '../ells/ells1122.sav' and see what slices_to_keep_in_full and do

Downloading data from 20081113 again in redone/ to see how it might fare being reanalysed for 3D work.
Looking into how it should be prepped also; seems like the only real issue for cor1 is background subtracting, as using /calroll will combine the roll background and the monthly minimum background in the prepping. Probably use total brightness for consistency with cor2 though it's ideally better to use polarised brightness to remove as much scattering and f-corona so low down.

20-04-10

Prepping the data:
20081113/redone/a/pB_bkgsub/ is the secchi_prep, list.filename, /polariz_on, /pb, /write_fts
20081113/redone/a/pB_calroll/ is the secchi_prep, list.filename, /polariz_on, /pb, /write_fts, /calroll

nb: don't think I need the /roll keyword for rotating the background if the difference is > 1 since it lists it in the prepping as ~0.3.

Viewing data at bytscl(alog(da), -25, -17)
fixed-difference smoothed seems best for viewing CME.

Meeting:
1) Plot WIND data
2) Study the radial velocity
3) Write editor/referee response.

Wrote VEL_SPREAD.pro to plot out the different heights vel_spread.pdf and show that the lull in velocity seems apparent across the front, and this is shown in the older plots of all_angs.pdf and kins_meanspread_deflect.pdf and kins_meanspread_deflect_h.pdf but these were for the old front not redone.
Looking at recpol.png of all the fronts plotted in same frames could it be an artifact of how the front 'distorts' as this distortion passes through the middle of the front to cause apparent increasing and decreasing acceleration before it propagates out with solar wind...?   --> see draft email today.
Wrote RECPOL_FRONTS.b and recpol_fronts.png
Writing code to take out only the parts of the front that aren't at the origin. REMOVE_ORIGIN.pro unfinished!!!

Wrote GET_MAX_COORDS.b and took out the maximum heights from the max+2flanksHHMM.sav files and saved MAX_HEIGHTS.sav   
Added the maximum velocity into vel_spread.pro and it hardly changes it at all !!! This isn't the proper way to do it though - want the max heights from the recpol (r,a) plots!
What if it's that I have to take the maximum height and pythagoras it ?

16-06-10

Saved MAX_R_HEIGHTS.sav and MAX_R_THETA.sav
Saved vel_spread.png from the code.
Saved MAX_FRONT_XZ.png comparing the Midpoint of Front against the maximum height on the front - both having showed same velocity trend.
Wrote PLOT_MAX_FRONTS_XZ.b
Wrote PLOT_MAX_FRONTS_XZ_PROM.b and saved max_fronts_xz_prom.png to include the prominence heights.

Emailed the Velocity Stall? email about the comparison of front measurments (and remade recpol_fronts_blue.png).

Edited vel_spread.pro with keyword prom for plotting the prominence velocity as inner-CME material, and emailed vel_spread_prom.png and vel_spread_prom_zoom.png.

Possibly see a GOES A-class flare at 06:30 for this 20081212 event?

Wrote KINS_NAT_COMMUN_XDIR.pro to change the mid_r and prominence height to cartesian and see how it affects the velocity profile:
 polrec, mid_r, mid_a, mid_rx, mid_rz, /degrees  and   polrec, prom_h, prom_lat, prom_hx, prom_hz, /degrees
and saved  kins_nat_commun_xdir_accel_time.pdf , kins_nat_commun_xdir_accel_height.pdf and emailed.

17-06-10

Finished writing WIND_PLOTTER.pro and using the data file 'OMNI_HRO_1MIN_9382.txt1'
wind_plotter,fl1,/no_lines,/tog and saved wind_plot.pdf and emailed.

Replied to email about plotting the 2 panels source54N.png and overplotted on kins_nat_commun_xdir_source54N.pdf

18-06-10

Edited the wind_plotter.pro and changed the wind_plot.pdf according to email suggestions.
Wrote PLOT_MAX_FRONTS_XZ_PROM_WIDTHS.b to see how all the width points look in xz plot too.

Wrote plot_different_kins_20101126.pro version of plot_different_kins.pro to run for obtaining the chi_squared of vel and accel of const. accel and non-constant accel models to compare the scatter of forward/reverse and centre differencing.

Made plot_different_kins_zero_a.pro and plot_different_kins_const_a.pro for zero and constant acceleration respectively.

Editing PLOT_DIFFERENT_KINS_CONST_A.pro and output const_a_forward_centre_noise001.pdf which plots the forward and centre difference of a model constand acceleration at 1% noise, with chi-squared fits to the constant acceleration (no errorbars).
const_a_forward_centre_noise005.pdf
const_a_forward_centre_noise010.pdf

Running the code many times will give a ditribution of final fits to the acceleration... write DISTRIBUTION_CONST_A.b

College Closed in the SNOW!
SOHO's 15th Birthday!

Looking at coding non_constant accel. using the equation 11.15 in Priest & Forbes.
Wrote NON_CONST.pro to just plot and test eqn 11.15.

07-12-10

Meeting:
Include in paper
1) mention of all possibe uncertainties/errors than are encompassed in errorbars. (pixel issues, psf, signal+noise)
2) show concisely how each scheme works with regards cadence / noise in a plot e.g. x-axis increasing cadence, y-axis how each scheme gets closer to the correct acceleration value
3) conclusions should include possible bootstrapping mentions etc of how to tackle issues in the future. Point of paper is just to highlight the issues!

Wrote PLOT_DIFFERENT_KINS_CADENCE.pro to test different schemes results for different cadences.
Run KINS_CADENCE.b to produce kins_cadence.txt to plot.

08-12-10

The attempt to do plot_different_kins_cadence.pro using kins_cadence.b and readcol on kins_cadence.txt doesn't work as currently coded - too difficult to try and sample the same point in the profile for changing cadence... maybe need to pick a point and count the cadence out from there!
Trying to do this in PLOT_DIFFERENT_KINS_CADENCE_FIXED.pro
IDL> for k=1,400 do plot_different_kins_cadence_fixed,k,500

09-12-10

Saved kins_cadence_fixed3.pdf up to kins_cadence_fixed1997.pdf to see how the different schemes fare on changing cadence.
Want to adapt it for another acceleration model.
Wrote PLOT_KINS_CADENCE_FIXEDMOVIE.b to see how a movie of the plots from plot_kins_cadence.b looks!
Wrote PLOT_DIFFERENT_KINS_CADENCE_FIXED2.pro to try changing around the acceleration model for testing the effects of different profiles with cadence.
