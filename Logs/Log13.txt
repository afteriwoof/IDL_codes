Set 2010 detections running on gail (issue with the 2013 fits files).

2nd week in Aber

Working on the newest sets of model CMEs. Checking out put via idea of kinematics profiles; heights might be offset, so a different slope could skew the velocity profiles but only by a set amount dependent on the orientation of the flux-rope and the spacecraft separations, to be tested.

Looked into kins_3d.pro with a view to writing kins_model.pro buried in the cme_model folder for the test case initially.

1st week back in Hawaii
