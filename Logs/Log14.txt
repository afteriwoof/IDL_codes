2014-01 week in Aberystwyth working with Huw.

Wrote RUN_AUTOMATED_REALTIME_ALERT.pro to test how a realtime detection in a single image can be done.
Wrote RUN_AUTOMATED_RELATIME_TEST.pro (on Dublin) to run a heap of fits through the run_automated_realtime_alert.pro code in order to test the alert scores over time and determine what thresholds are most appropriate for CME alerts.
(output going into ~/Postdoc_largefiles/detections_realtime/ folder as first test).
Wrote GATHER_SCORES.pro to gather up the scores.txt from every day and combine a years worth to inspect the detections.
Plotted the scores against parameters from the CDAW catalogue, called using ssw_getcme_list.pro

On Dublin:
in folder Postdoc_largefiles/
restore, 'score_str.sav'
inspect_gather_scores, score_str
save output to CME_det_ims/
Then On JayDog2:
in folder Postdoc/Automation/realtime/
rsync -anvuSH jbyrne@dublin.ifa.hawaii.edu:Postdoc_largefiles/CME_det_ims/ ./CME_det_ims/
fls = file_Search('CME_det_ims/*sav')
inspect_top_dets, fls
