\section{Introduction}
     \label{S-Introduction} 



 

\section{Numerical Differentiation Techniques} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
When presented with a moving object through a sequence of image frames such that it is possible to measure it's position at each time step, the technique of numerical differentiation is often used to derive the velocity and acceleration of the object. In the standard 2-point approach, it should be possible to derive the time evolution of a system at time step $t+\Delta t$ according to the system values at time step $t$. This may be applied through the technique of forward, reverse or centre differencing, resulting in an estimate of the speed of the object at a specific time step given its positional information. More commonly, a 3-point Langrangian interpolation is applied to better approximate the kinematics of a moving object by solving for the Lagrange polynomials that bestacross 3 given datapoints (e.g. \textsc{deriv.pro} in IDL). Each of these schemes is based upon the Taylor series expansion of a real function $f(t)$ about the point $t=t_0$:
\begin{equation}
\label{taylor1}
f(t) \; = \; f(t_0) + f'(t_0)(t-t_0) +  \frac{f''(t_0)}{2!}(t-t_0)^{2}   + ...
\end{equation}
An alternative form is obtained by letting $t-t_0=\Delta t$ so that $t=t_0+\Delta t$ to give:
\begin{equation}
\label{taylor2}
f(t_0+\Delta t) \; = \; f(t_0)+f'(t_0)\Delta t +  \frac{f''(t_0)}{2!}(\Delta t)^{2}  + ...
\end{equation}
This expansion can be used to determine the numerical derivative of a function according to the choice of technique, detailed below.

\subsection{Forward Differencing} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The forward differencing technique involves extrapolating forward from each time step $t$ to derive the evolution of the system. Thus rewriting Equation~\ref{taylor2} to express the distance measurement at time step $t+\Delta t$ gives:
\begin{equation}
r(t + \Delta t) \; = \; r(t) + r'(t)\Delta t +  \frac{r''(t)}{2!}(\Delta t)^{2} + ...
\end{equation}
%This equation can be re-arranged to give
%\begin{equation}
%r'(t)\Delta t = r(t + \Delta t) - r(t) -  \frac{r''(t)}{2!}(\Delta t)^{2} - \frac{r'''(t)}{3!}(\Delta t)^{3}  + ...
%\end{equation}
%which then gives
%\begin{equation}
%r'(t) = \frac{r(t + \Delta t) - r(t)}{\Delta t} -  \frac{r''(t)}{2!}(\Delta t) - \frac{r'''(t)}{3!}(\Delta t)^{2}  + ...
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow \quad v \; \equiv \; r'(t) \; = \; \frac{r(t + \Delta t) - r(t)}{\Delta t} + O(\Delta t)
\end{equation}
where $O(\Delta t)$ is the truncation error term, determined by the distance between neighbouring points ($\Delta t$). %This technique assumes a straight line gradient between points. 
%This estimate of the velocity is dependent on the initial units used for the distance. In the case of the simulation work done here, the units of distance are mega-metres (1~Mm = $10^6$~m). This produces an estimate of velocity in units of Mm~s$^{-1}$. To convert this to acceptable units of km~s$^{-1}$ requires multiplying the estimated velocity values by $10^{3}$. This has been done in all plots showing the numerically derived velocity. Similarly, converting the acceleration from units of Mm~s$^{-2}$ requires multiplying the estimated acceleration values by $10^{6}$.
%The forward-difference technique may be used to obtain the velocity and acceleration of the data numerically, without the use of fits. If the data can be modeled as a linear function of the form $r(t) = r_0 + v_0 t$, with a noise term of the form $\delta r$ added to the distance data (i.e.:\ $r(t) = r_0 + v_0 t + \delta r$), the velocity of the data can be estimated as
%\begin{equation}
%v = v_{0} + \frac{\delta r_{(t + \Delta t)} - \delta r_{t}}{\Delta t}
%\end{equation} 
%In this case, the velocity is estimated as the initial velocity $v_0$ with a correction term that accounts for the variation in the original data-set due to noise. This correction term is unique to each data-point due to the random nature of the applied noise.
It is possible to derive the value of the truncation error term in terms of the original $r(t)$ values. The truncation error is given as
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t) = \frac{r''(t)}{2!}(\Delta t)
\end{equation}
The $r''(t)$ term may be decomposed using the original forward-difference definition:
\begin{equation}
r''(t) = \frac{r'(t + \Delta t) - r'(t)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
Rewriting each term using the original functional forms produces
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t) = \frac{r(t + 2\Delta t) - 2r(t + \Delta t) + r(t)}{2!\Delta t}
\end{equation}
The error term associated with the velocity estimate using the forward-difference technique is therefore dependent on the value of the function $r(t)$ at the points $t$, $t+\Delta t$ and $t+2\Delta t$.

This equation must be modified when dealing with the error associated with the acceleration estimate. In this case, the truncation error term would be given as:
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t) = \frac{v(t + 2\Delta t) - 2v(t + \Delta t) + v(t)}{2!\Delta t}
\end{equation}
Here, the velocity function $v(t)$ is treated as the base function, rather than the distance function $r(t)$ as above. 

The forward difference technique inherently assumes that there is a straight-line gradient between points, and it's application removes a point from the end of the dataset.

\subsection{Reverse Differentiation}

The reverse difference technique works in the same manner as the forward difference but is applied at the point $t - \Delta t$ by extrapolating backwards from the point $t$. This results in:
\begin{equation}
v \; \equiv \; r'(t) \; = \; \frac{r(t ) - r(t - \Delta t)}{\Delta t} + O(\Delta t)
\end{equation}
where $O(\Delta t)$ is the truncation error term which, as with the forward difference method, is determined by the distance between neighbouring points ($\Delta t$), assuming a straight line gradient between points.

%The units of the velocity estimate produced using this method once again depend on the units used for the distance. The velocity estimate produced using this method must again be multiplied by $10^{3}$ to give an estimate of velocity in units of km~s$^{-1}$, while the acceleration estimate must be multiplied by $10^{6}$ to give an estimate in units of m~s$^{-2}$. As with the forward-difference technique, this has been done for all plots showing the velocity derived numerically using the reverse-difference technique.

Once again, the truncation error can be estimated in terms of the original distance function $r(t)$, given by:
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t) \; = \; \frac{r(t) - 2r(t - \Delta t) + r(t - 2\Delta t)}{2!\Delta t}
\end{equation}
%This shows a similar form to the truncation error estimate for the forward-difference technique. Both techniques are quite similar and it is not unexpected that they should show a similar form for the truncation error estimate. However, despite the similar form, the two estimates are not necessarily equal.

As before, this equation can be modified to find the truncation error associated with the acceleration term by taking the velocity function $v(t)$ as the base function rather than the distance function $r(t)$. When this is done, this produces a truncation error of:
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t) \; = \; \frac{v(t) - 2v(t - \Delta t) + v(t - 2\Delta t)}{2!\Delta t}
\end{equation}

Similar to forward differencing, the reverse difference technique inherently assumes that there is a straight-line gradient between points, and it's application removes a point from the beginning of the dataset.



\subsection{Centre Differentiation}

The centre difference technique uses the two neighbouring points to the point $r(t)$ under examination, i.e., $r(t - \Delta t)$ and $r(t + \Delta t)$ according to the equation:
\begin{equation}
v \; \equiv \; r'(t) \; = \; \frac{r(t + \Delta t) - r(t - \Delta t)}{2 \Delta t} + O(\Delta t)^{2}
\end{equation}
where $O(\Delta t)^{2}$ is the truncation error term. The truncation error term in this case is determined by the square of the distance between neighbouring points, producing a more accurate estimate than the forward and reverse difference methods. 

%As with the forward and reverse-difference techniques, the velocity estimate produced by the centre-difference method must be multiplied by $10^{3}$ to give the physically realistic units of km~s$^{-1}$, with the acceleration estimate multiplied by $10^{6}$ to give the physically realistic units of m~s$^{-2}$. This has been done for all the simulated data-sets that have been processed using the centre-difference technique.

%\begin{figure}[!t] 
%  \centerline{
%              \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,trim = 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm,clip=]{images/c_diff_lin.eps}
%              }
%\caption[Centre difference technique simulation]{\emph{Top}: Simulated distance-time data with noise added. \emph{Middle}: Velocity-time data obtained using a centre-difference technique. \emph{Bottom}: Acceleration-time data obtained using a centre-difference technique. }
%\label{fig:c_diff_sim}
%\end{figure}

The centre-difference method effectively smoothes the data set while differentiating it by using the two points either side of the point under examination. The truncation error term may be written as:
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t)^{2} \; = \; \frac{r(t + 3\Delta t) - 3r(t + \Delta t) + 3r(t - \Delta t) - r(t - 3\Delta t)}{(3!)(8)\Delta t}
\end{equation}
This produces a mean truncation error estimate that is much smaller than the mean truncation error calculated using the forward and reverse-difference techniques.

As with the forward and reverse-difference techniques, the truncation error term can be estimated for the acceleration term by using the velocity function $v(t)$ as the base function rather than the distance function $r(t)$. When this is done, it produces the estimate
\begin{equation}
O(\Delta t^{2}) = \frac{v(t + 3\Delta t) - 3v(t + \Delta t) + 3v(t - \Delta t) - v(t - 3\Delta t)}{(3!)(8)\Delta t}
\end{equation}
for the truncation error of the acceleration data. 

The centre-difference technique produces a mean truncation error estimate and a scatter in the data that are much smaller than the forward and reverse-difference techniques. As a result, the centre-difference technique produces a better estimate of the velocity and acceleration, and their associated truncation errors than either the forward or reverse-difference techniques.


\subsection{Lagrangian Interpolation}

A more advanced numerical differentiation method is the three-point Lagrangian method used by the \textsc{deriv} routine in IDL. This method uses three adjacent points ($t-\Delta t$, $t$ and $t+\Delta t$) to fit a Lagrange polynomial function of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
P(x) &=& \frac{(x - t)(x - (t+\Delta t))}{((t-\Delta t) - t)((t-\Delta t)- (t+\Delta t))}y_{1} \nonumber \\
&+& \frac{(x - (t-\Delta t))(x - (t+\Delta t))}{(t - (t-\Delta t))(t - (t+\Delta t))}y_{2} \nonumber \\ 
&+& \frac{(x - (t-\Delta t))(x - t)}{((t+\Delta t) - (t-\Delta t))((t+\Delta t) - t))}y_{3}
\end{eqnarray}
to the three points, and hence find the derived value at a point numerically.

This method gives a more accurate indication of the numerically differentiated data as it does not assume a straight line in between points. In addition, the routine compensates for edge points, increasing the errors of the points. It also uses three points to find the numerical derivative, rather than two (c.f. centre, forward and reverse-difference techniques). The Lagrangian technique also smoothes the data-set, removing the spiky appearance that arises from use of the different Taylor series techniques.

%\end{deluxetable}

 The problems encountered in this work arise from the small data-sets available in the case of these disturbances. The small data-sets mean that there are only four or five points available of which three are needed to calculate the numerical derivative of each point. This makes the Lagrangian technique unsuitable for estimating the kinematics of these disturbances.

The three-point Lagrangian interpolation method used by IDL uses the standard deviation of the derivative calculated by the Lagrangian polynomial as the truncation error of the numerical derivative. This produces a consistent estimate of the mean truncation error that only varies with the end-points due to the increased uncertainty of these points.

Table~\ref{tbl:numdiff} shows the different estimates for the truncation error term for each numerical differencing technique. These truncation error estimates are given in terms of the original base function, the exception being for the Lagrangian technique, which takes the standard deviation of the Lagrange derivative at a point as the truncation error estimate at that point.


%Figure~\ref{fig:l_diff_sim} shows the three-point Lagrangian technique operating on the simulated data-set used for the forward, reverse and centre difference methods. This figure has the same scaling as Figures~\ref{fig:f_diff_sim} to \ref{fig:c_diff_sim} to show the difference in errors between the different methods. The Lagrangian technique has much lower errors than the forward or reverse difference methods, and also smaller errors than the centre difference method. The errors are comparable with the data itself, but are still much larger than is reasonable for accurate data analysis. The Lagrangian method also has a problem with the edges of numerically derived data, and often drags these points downwards. This can result in false conclusions being made about the derived data.

\subsection{Using \BibTeX} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \label{S-BibTeX}
  %{\S}{\bf --- Why using \BibTeX ? } \\
  The use of \BibTeX\ simplifies the inclusion of references. Only the 
references cited and labeled in the text are included at compilation, 
and an error message appears if some references
are missing.  Any new reference will automatically be written at the correct 
location in the reference list after compilation. 
Moreover the references are stored, in any order, in a separate file
(with the \texttt{.bib} extension) in the \BibTeX\ format, so independently of 
the journal format. Such a personal reference file can be re-used with any journal.
The formatting of the references and their listing order are made automatically
at compilation (using the information given in the \texttt{.bst} file). 
        
  %{\S}{\bf --- Downloading references} \\
  The references in \BibTeX\ format can be downloaded from the 
Astrophysics Data System (ADS), then stored
in \verb+SOLA_bibliography_example.bib+  (file name of the present example).
The main extra work is to define a proper and easy label for each citation
(a convenient one is simply first-author-name-year).  Furthermore, it is better
to have the journal names defined by commands (for example 
\texttt{$\backslash$solphys)}, as defined at the beginning of 
this \texttt{.tex} file.
This provides an homogeneity in the reference list and permits flexibility
when changing for journals.   Some caution should be taken for some journals
since ADS does not necessarily provide a uniform format for the
journal names. This is the case for \jgr\  Moreover since
\jgr\ has a new way to refer to an article 
(since 2002 it has no page number), then the ADS references need to be corrected. 
More generally, it is worth verifying
each reference from the original publication (independently of \BibTeX\ use).

  %{\S}{\bf --- Compilation: general} \\
   The full \LaTeX\ and \BibTeX\ compilation is made in four steps: 
\begin{tabbing}
1) {\tt latex filename}\qquad\qquad\=(stores the labels in the {\tt .aux} file)\\
2) {\tt bibtex filename}\>(loads the bibliography in the {\tt .bbl} file)\\
3) {\tt latex filename}\>(reads the .bbl, stores in the {\tt .aux})\\
4) {\tt latex filename}\>(replaces all labels)  
\end{tabbing}
   where \texttt{filename} is the name of your \LaTeX\ file (for example, 
the present file) {\bf without} typing its \texttt{.tex} extension.
If a \texttt{(?)} is still present in the output (at the place of a label),
it means that this label has not been properly defined. 
 (for example, \LaTeX\ labels are case sensitive).
Any undefined label has a warning written in the \texttt{console window}
(it is better to have this window open by default, since \LaTeX\ warning and 
error messages are very useful to localize the problem).

  %{\S}{\bf --- Compilation: simple} \\
  When the references are not changed, it is unnecessary to re-run \BibTeX .
When no new labels are added, running latex once is sufficient to refresh
the \LaTeX\ output. So, except for
the first, and the final time (safest), running \LaTeX\ once is sufficient
in most cases to update the \LaTeX\ output, if the compilation files 
created are not erased! For example \BibTeX\ keeps the bibliography in the usual 
environment,\\
  \verb+ \begin{thebibliography}{} ... \end{thebibliography}+\\
in the file with the \verb+.bbl+ extension.  

\subsection{Miscellaneous Other Features} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \label{S-Miscellaneous} 
Long URL's can be quite messy when broken across lines
\texttt{ http://gong.nso.edu/data/magmap/} as normal text,
however the \texttt{url} package does a nice job of this, \textit{e.g.} 
\url{http://gong.nso.edu/data/magmap/}.
   
\section{Conclusion} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \label{S-Conclusion} 
      We hope authors of {\it Solar Physics} will find this guide useful.
Please send us feedback on how to improve it.
      
  \LaTeX\ is very convenient to write a scientific text, in particular
with the use of labels for figures, tables, and references. Moreover, the labels and list of references are checked by the software against
one another, and, the formatting should be effortless with \BibTeX.
