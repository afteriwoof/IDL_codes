\chapter{Numerical differencing techniques}
\label{chap:numdiff}

Several different numerical differencing techniques were studied for this report. The Taylor expansion method was used to derive the forward, reverse and centre differencing techniques, while the built-in IDL numerical differencing technique (\textsc{deriv}) uses a three-point Lagrangian technique. 

A Taylor series is the expansion of the real function $f(t)$ about the point $t=a$ and generally takes the form
\begin{equation}
f(t) = f(a) + f'(a)(t-a) +  \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(t-a)^{2} + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(t-a)^{3}  + ...
\end{equation}
The difference between points $(t-a)$ is defined as $\Delta t$. This expansion can be used to determine the numerical derivative of a given point using a variety of different methods, each of which is outlined in the following sections.
